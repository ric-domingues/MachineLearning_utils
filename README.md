# ric-domingues/MachineLearning_utils
## Description: 
#### This repository aims to serve a collection of Machine-Learning tools and simple implementation examples. This is a living repository that will get populated as new tools and examples are worked on.

## Code description: 
- Tensorflow_nonlinear_example01.ipynb: simple jupiter notebook to illustrate the capability of tensorflow neural networks to capture/model inherent non-linear relationships between predictors and target dataset. In this example, a single predictor is used.

## Notes

- the subdirectory **HTML_copies** contains copies of the notebooks on HTML format, which can be used to quickly display graphs and dashboards without having to run the notebook
